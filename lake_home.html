         <p>Make the <em>Great Lakescape Lodge</em> your destination in beautiful
         Door County. Nestled on the shores of Lake Michigan at Bailey's Harbor, 
         our lodge is close to everything that Door County has to offer.</p >

         <p>We are a family-owned and operated establishment and have been part 
         of the Northern Wisconsin vacation scene for 25 years. The lodge is a great
         place for a romantic getaway or a family reunion. We also cater weddings
         and can provide all of the amenities to make your time here a special
         one.</p >

         <p>It's our goal to make every guest feel pampered; from the gourmet breakfast 
         and afternoon tea, to the special touches you will find in every room. 
         Families can enjoy our rec room and pool and outdoor equipment for boating 
         and cycling; but there are also quiet secluded spots for people who are 
         just looking to get away for a restful weekend.</p >

         <p>Come and see for yourself what keeps our guests coming back year 
         after year. We are open April 1st to October 31st. If you have never visited 
         Door County before, let us be your guide to the wonderful opportunities that 
         await you.</p >
